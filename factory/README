Overview
--------
  Factory is a C++ class library that implements a recursive representation
of multivariate polynomial data.  It is being developed at the University
of Kaiserslautern as an independent and self-contained part of the computer
algebra system Singular (developed by G.-M. Greuel, G. Pfister and
H. Schoenemann).

  Factory handles sparse multivariate polynomials over different
coefficient domains, such as Z, Q and GF(q), as well as algebraic
extensions over Q and GF(q) in an efficient way.  The recursive
representation gives a univariate view to multivariate polynomials.  This
means that each polynomial is represented as a univariate polynomial in a
so-called main variable with coefficients which are elements of a
polynomial ring.

  The interface to the polynomial system of Factory is provided by a single
class CanonicalForm which can deal with elements of the coefficient domain
as well as polynomials.  Using operator overloading, you can handle
polynomial data similarly to built-in types such as the machine integers.
For example, to add together two polynomials one simply uses the '+'
operator.  Because of this, Factory is easy to use even if you are not
familar with C++ programming.

  There are a couple of utility classes provided by Factory such as lists,
arrays, polynomial maps, etc.  These make the usage more comfortable.

  Factory includes algorithms for computing univariate and multivariate
gcds, resultants, chinese remainders and several algorithms to factorize
univariate polynomials over the integers and over finite fields.
Factorization of multivariate polynomials over the integers is in beta test
stage.


Installation
------------
  See the INSTALL file for instructions on how to install Factory.  The
installation procedure conforms more or less to the GNU standard:

  ./configure; make; make gftables; make install; make installgftables

However, I recommend to read the instructions since there are a lot of
non-standard options to configure.


Distribution
------------
  The newest version of Factory is always available by anonymous ftp from

		www.mathematik.uni-kl.de:/pub/Math/Factory

The Factory distribution consists of three archives:

o the Factory source code (factory-<version>.tgz);
o some preliminary documentation on Factory (factory-doc-prelim.tgz);
o Factory GF(q) addition tables (see below).


Prerequisites
-------------
  You need GNU make to build and install Factory.  Furthermore, I strongly
recommend to build Factory with GNU CC (version 2.7 or newer).  To build
Factory and to link your programs with Factory you need the GNU Multiple
Precision Library (GMP, version 2.0 or newer).  The GMP library is
available at ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu or its mirrors.  Alternatively, Factory may
be linked with the so called small GMP library which comes with the full
version of Singular (not recommended).

Configure options:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  --with-gmp(=<gmp_inc_path>(,<gmp_lib_path>))
                          specify where to find gmp library.
  --enable-gmp            together with --with-Singular means: installation
                          in process, be graceful when there is no gmp.h

  If <gmp_lib_path> is not given, but <gmp_inc_path> is,
'<gmp_inc_path>../lib/' is used as <gmp_lib_path>.  If neither
<gmp_lib_path> nor <gmp_inc_path> is specified, configure looks in the
standard system locations for GMP.

  Furthermore, you may specify the symbolic directory '$(includedir)' for
<gmp_inc_path>:

  --with-gmp='$(includedir)'

  This is useful when Factory is delivered as a part of a larger package
which also provides the GMP library.  In this case, at configuration time
there will not be any gmp.h.  Without this option, Factory's configure
script will exit with an error message.  If this symbolic directory is
given, the configure script will not look for gmp.h and libgmp.a.  Rather,
it will add the option '-I$(includedir)' to its $(CXXFLAGS) and the option
'-L$(libdir)' to its $(LDFLAGS) assuming that at compilation time gmp.h and
libgmp.a will reside in these directories.
  The option --enable-gmp does the same, but it is a special (and ugly)
gift to Singular, so it may be used with option --with-Singular only.


Memory manager
--------------
  You can use one of the memory managment tools provided with Factory.
There are the 'new' and the 'old' memory manager.  In fact, on some systems
the 'old' memory managment seems to be faster then the new one, but so far
there have not been systematic timings.
  You may trace the actions (alloc/free) of the new memory manager by
enabling memory managment.  This produces a *lot* of output.

Configure options:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  --with-memman(=<memman>) specify factory memory manager.
                          <memman> is either 'old' (default), 'new', or 'no'.
  --enable-memdebug=<level> switch on memory managment debugging.  Meaningful
                          with --with-memman=new only.  <level> may be either
                          'no' (default), 'normal', or 'full'.


Stream IO
---------
  For use with other systems which have there own IO routines to print
polynomials it is possible to switch of Factory's stream IO.  In this case,
you do not need to link libg++ or libiostream with Factory.

Configure options:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  --disable-streamio      build factory without streamio


Diagnostic messages
-------------------
Factory has three types of diagnostic messages:
- Assertions (implemented by the ASSERT macros in assert.h) are used to
  ensure preconditions before running an algorithm.  A typical example is
  to test f != 0 before dividing by f.
- Debugoutput (implemented by the DEBOUT macros in debug.h/debug.cc) is
  used to trace complex algorithms, e.g. factorization.
- Timing information may be accumulated and printed using the TIMING macros
  in timing.h

  Since all diagnostic messages are implemented using preprocessor macros,
they will completely cease when disbled, thus avoiding any impact on speed.
For more information, see section 'Configuring and building Factory for
 different configurations' in the INSTALL file.

Configure options:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  --enable-assertions     build factory with assertions activated
  --enable-timing         build factory so it will print timing information
  --enable-debugoutput    build factory so it will print debugging information


GF(q) tables
------------
  Factory uses addition tables to calculate in GF(p^n) in an efficient way.

NOTE: Since the format of the GF(q) tables changed from Factory Version
1.2b to Factory Version 1.3a you should get/create them by new!

There are two possibilities to get these tables:
o you get them from the net (factory-gftables.tgz) where you got Factory
  from.  The files unpack into a directory gftables/.
o you create them with gengftables which is a part of Factory.  Building
  the tables takes quite a while!
See the INSTALL file for more information.


A note on Singular
------------------
  If you have received this Factory distribution together with Singular you
do not have to worry about compilation or installation at all.  The
installation procedure for Singular should do everything for you.  If you
want to configure/build the package on your own instead of letting
Singulars configure do the work you should:

  ./configure --with-Singular --enable-gmp
	(or, equivalently: )
  ./configure --with-Singular --with-gmp='${includedir}'

  Furthermore, you should specify --prefix so 'make install' will install
the files in the places where Singular looks for them.  By default, this is
the top directory of the Singular distribution.  In this case you have to
specify '--prefix=..'.

  The Singular GF(q) tables are the same as the Factory GF(q) tables.
However, Singular uses a different naming scheme.  Therefore, a Factory
configured with '--with-Singular' will not find the GF(q) tables created by
gengftables.  But this is not a major drawback since Singular is
distributed with ready-to-use GF(q) tables.

Configure options:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  --with-Singular         build for use with computer algebra system Singular.

  Except from setting the #define SINGULAR, this option only changes the
defaults to: '--with-memman=no --disable-streamio'.


Configure options, dependencies
-------------------------------
- do not configure --with-Singular --with-memman.  In this case
  both Singular and the library will try to initialize memory
  managment.

- do not configure --disable-streamio --enable-debugoutput.  The
  DEBOUT macros need stream IO.

- you may configure --with-Singular --enable-streamio, but this
  is not supported by Singular.  You will have to change manually
  Singular's Makefile.  The same is true for --with-Singular
  --enable-debugoutput.

- you may configure --with-Singular --enable-timing, but this
  will not have any visible effect (except from a slightly slower
  running time) because Singular will not print the timing
  results.

- --enable-gmp has an effect only together with --with-Singular

- --with-memdebug has an effect only together with
  --with-memman=new


Documentation
-------------
  So far there are only preliminary versions of a user/reference manual and
a tutorial ('A quick start into Factory').  Please do not expect them to
be complete or even error-free.  For this reason, the documentation is not
included in the source code archive (factory-<version>.tgz).  Instead, the
sources and compiled dvi files reside in factory-doc-prelim.tgz. They will
unpack into a directory factory-doc-prelim/.


Examples and Tests
------------------
  So far neither examples nor tests, sorry.  You may have a look at
gengftables.cc which is an application of the most basic Factory features.


Comments, questions, bug reports
--------------------------------
  Factory is a project in evolution.  That means there is no guarantee that
Factory is bug free.  I am sure that there are bugs or at least features.
If you find bugs or if you find a strange behavior of the library, please
let me know (e-mail: Jens Schmidt <schmidt@mathematik.uni-kl.de>).
Comments and questions are welcome, too.
