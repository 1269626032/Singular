		 INSTALL file for Factory on Windows NT 4.0
		 ==========================================

NOTE: The copyright state of Factory is given in the file COPYING
in the top level directory of Factory.

NOTE: Please read also the file INSTALL in the factory root directory.

This is a prerelease of the Factory-Port to Microsoft Windows NT 4.0 using
the Microsoft Visual C++ 5.0 compiler. To compile Factory on Windows NT you
have also to copy a ported version of the GNU MP library which you can
download from the same site you have downloaded Factory.

To build Factory on Windows NT you have to do the following steps:

1) Copy the files gmp.h and gmp.lib into the Factory directory.
2) Change into the winnt directory.
3) Make Factory with
               nmake /f nt.mak
4) There is no installation script yet. So you have to copy the library files
   gmp.lib and factory.lib as well as gmp.h, factory.h, factoryconf.h and
   the template subdirectory to a suitable place on your system.

NOTE: There is no support for GF(q) tables yet!
