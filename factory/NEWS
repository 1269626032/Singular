New features in Factory, version 1.3a:
======================================
  Besides minor changes at 'source code level' (bug fixes, new features)
which are not really visible to the user in general there are quite a lot
of changes at 'organization level' (aka 'preprocessor level') and at
'distribution level' (configure, Makefile).


Source code level:
------------------
o Serious bug in univariate factorization in characterstic 0 fixed (by
  Ruediger Stobbe).

o New gcd algorithm (sparse modular), not fully tested by now (contributed
  by Marion Bruder).  Switch on with SW_USE_SPARSEMOD.

o Various minor bug fixes.



Organization level:
-------------------
o Factory translates now on Macintosh with Metroworks
  CodeWarrior Academic Pro 11 (changes by Wilfred Pohl)

o So called 'new' memory manager (written by Ruediger Stobbe) added to
  distribution.  So far no timigs available which memory manager is faster.

o ASSERT, DEBOUT, TIMING macros streamlined

o Factory's IO completely re-organized (that was a mess!).  It is now
  possible to switch off everything which is related to stream IO (use
  --disbale-streamio option to configure).  This way it is possible to link
  Factory without libg++.  Changes include:

  - everything related to stream IO wrapped by '#ifndef NOSTREAMIO'
  - all error messages/debug output messages rewritten so that they use the
    ASSERT and DEBOUT macros
  - furthermore, it was necessary to change the way the GF(q) tables are
    read.  As a consequence, the format of the GF(q) tables slightly
    changed, too.  You have to generate/get them from net by new.


Distribution level:
-------------------
o The organization of the distribution as well as the compile/install
  procedure totally changed.  It is now more GNU-like.  See the INSTALL
  file and the README file for more information.

o The file names of the template sources changed.  To make them less
  canonical, all names are prefixed with 'ftmpl_' ('Factory template') now.

o The installation target directories and their structure changed a little
  bit.  See the INSTALL file for more information.

New features in Factory, version 1.2c:
======================================
  Version 1.2c is a more or less inofficial version distributed with
Singular 1.0.  I hope it does not distribute too far...  The description of
new features to version 1.3a cope the description of new features to this
version.
