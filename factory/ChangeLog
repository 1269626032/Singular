	* configure.in: removed some stupid warnings when 'dangerous'
	  combinations of with's/enable's are specified
	  some other fixes in configures messages
	  doc fix
	  (AC_ARG_ENABLE(memdebug)): removed code which sets
	  enable_memdebug to 'normal' since this is really never tested
	  (AC_ARG_WITH(gmp, builtingmp)): new command line options.  rest
	  of configure.in adapted to the new scheme of specifying where
	  gmp lives

	* GNUmakefile.in (distsrc): gengftables added to the distribution

	* configure.in: --with-Singular --enable-debugoutput is now
	  possible.  so is --with-Singular --enable-timing

	* GNUmakefile.in (gengftables.o): added check which makes make
	  complain if factory was not configured in the right way

	* configure.in: removed checks on sizeof(int) == sizeof(void *)
	  == 4

	* debug.h: removed dependency on NDEBUG

	* factoryconf.template: doc fix

	* config.h.in: config.h.in is now a real source file and not
	  longer created from acconfig.h
	  (INCL_CONFIG_H): added flag to prevent multiple inclusion of
 	  config.h

	* GNUmakefile.in ($(srcdir)/configure): make will not complain
	  about a missing autoconf any longer
	  ($(srcdir)/config.h.in, $(srcdir)/stamp-h.in,
 	  realmaintainerclean, dist, distfiles): instead of creating
 	  config.h.in we will deliver it as a real source file

	* canonicalform.cc (operator >>): returns 0 now when compiled with
	  Singular and with stream IO enabled
