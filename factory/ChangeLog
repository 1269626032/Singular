Fri Jun  6 09:38:05 1997  Jens Schmidt  <schmidt@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* configure.in: removed some stupid warnings when 'dangerous'
	  combinations of with's/enable's are specified
	  some other fixes in configures messages
	  doc fix
	  (AC_ARG_ENABLE(memdebug)): removed code which sets
	  enable_memdebug to 'normal' since this is really never tested
	  (AC_ARG_WITH(gmp, builtingmp)): new command line options.  rest
	  of configure.in adapted to the new scheme of specifying where
	  gmp lives

	* GNUmakefile.in (distsrc): gengftables added to the distribution
	  (distfiles): ChangeLog added to the distribution
	  (clean): gengftables added

Thu Jun  5 15:03:48 1997  Jens Schmidt  <schmidt@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	* configure.in: --with-Singular --enable-debugoutput is now
	  possible.  so is --with-Singular --enable-timing

	* GNUmakefile.in (gengftables.o): added check which makes make
	  complain if factory was not configured in the right way

	* configure.in: removed checks on sizeof(int) == sizeof(void *)
	  == 4

	* debug.h: removed dependency on NDEBUG

	* factoryconf.template: doc fix

	* config.h.in: config.h.in is now a real source file and not
	  longer created from acconfig.h
	  (INCL_CONFIG_H): added flag to prevent multiple inclusion of
 	  config.h

	* GNUmakefile.in ($(srcdir)/configure): make will not complain
	  about a missing autoconf any longer
	  ($(srcdir)/config.h.in, $(srcdir)/stamp-h.in,
 	  realmaintainerclean, dist, distfiles): instead of creating
 	  config.h.in we will deliver it as a real source file

	* canonicalform.cc (operator >>): returns 0 now when compiled with
	  Singular and with stream IO enabled

Before Mon Jun  4 1997 Jens Schmidt <schmidt@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	This is a list of most of the changes made after I took the
	responsibility for factory development and before I started to
	update the ChangeLog regularily.  It is unlikely to be complete...

	* assert.h (NOASSERT, NDEBUG): the define to switch the assertions
	  off is NOASSERT instead of NDEBUG.  But NDEBUG works, too, for
	  backward compatibility.
	  (__ASSERT1, ASSERT1, STICKYASSERT1): new assert macros which
	  print additional argument
	  (DEBINCLEVEL, DEBDECLEVEL, DEBOUTSL, DEBOUT, DEBOUTLN): debug
	  functionality moved to debug.h and debug.cc
	  (PVIRT_VOID, PVIRT_INTCF, PVIRT_BOOL, PVIRT_INT, PVIRT_CHARCC):
	  PVIRT_*-functionality moved from int_cf.h to assert.h
	  (__WARN, WARN, STICKYWARN): new macros
	  (__ASSERT, __STICKYASSERT): the preprocessor instead of
 	  fpritnf() pastes the message into the format string now
	  
	* assert.cc: renamed to debug.cc
	
	* debug.h, debug.cc: new files.  DEBOUT-functionality moved from
	  assert.h/assert.cc to these files.  All files which need this
	  functionality include debug.h.
	  (DEBUGOUTPUT, NDEBUG): DEBUGOUTPUT is switched off now if NDEBUG
	  is switched on
	  (DEBOUT, DEBOUTLN): slightly modified so they print 'objects'
	  now instead of only one 'msg' and one 'object'.  All callers
	  changed.
	  (deb_level, level_msg, deb_inc_level): modified so
	  deb_inc_level()'s output is more pretty at time of first call

	* cf_gcd.cc (DEBOUT): debug output changed to calls of DEBOUT
	  macros

	* cf_linsys.cc (TIMING): #define TIMING removed
	  (DEBOUT): debug output rewritten and changed to calls of DEBOUT
	  macros
	  (linearSystemSolve, determinant, determinant2): typedefs int_ptr
	  introduced and used

	* fac_berlekamp.cc (QPrintFF, QPrintGF, DEBOUT): debug output
	  changed to calls of DEBOUT macros

	* fac_distrib.cc (DEBUGOUTPUT): #undef DEBUGOUTPUT removed

	* fac_ezgcd.cc (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING, timing.h): some spurious
	  #define's and #include's removed

	* fac_multihensel.cc (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING): some spurious
	  #define's removed

	* fac_multivar.cc (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING): some spurious
	  #define's removed

	* fac_univar.cc (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING, sys/times.h): some spurious
	  #define's and #include's removed
	  (TIMING, timing.h): timing stuff changed to calls of TIMING
	  macros
	  (DEBOUT, DEBOUTLN, DEBINCLEVEL, DEBDECLEVEL): debug output
	  slightly rewritten
	  (hprint, DEBOUTHPRINT, NDEBUG): calls to function hprint()
	  wrapped by macro DEBOUTHPRINT, which definitions depends on
	  DEBUGOUTPUT (instead of NDEBUG, as before).  All callers
	  changed.
	  (MAX_FP_FAC, max_fp_fac): #define changed to const int
	  (initHG, ZFactorizeUnivariate): added STICKYWARNings because of
	  some strange errors which occure in this function
	  (kBound): added cast to double in calculation of the bound
	  (UnivariateQuadraticLift): added cast to double in calculation
	  of no_iter
	  (ZFactorizeUnivariate): removed spurious declaration of CFFList
	  G.  Some trivial structural changes.  Removed test on D != 0
	  before deleting D.
	  doc fix

	* cf_reval.h (iostream.h): spurious #include <iostream.h> removed

	* cf_switches.h (RATTIONAL): spurious #define RATIONAL removed
