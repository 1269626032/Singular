Before Mon Jun  4 1997 Jens Schmidt <schmidt@mathematik.uni-kl.de>

	This is a list of most of the changes I made after I took the
	responsibility for factory development and before I started to
	update the ChangeLog regularily.  It is unlikely to be complete.

	Besides minor changes at "source code level" (bug fixes, new
 	features) which are not really visible to the user in general
 	there are quite a lot of changes at "organization level" (aka
 	preprocessor level) and at "distribution level" (configure,
	Makefile).


	First, the changes at distribution level:

	* bin: some useful/necessary scripts added to distribution
	* install-sh: moved to bin

	* ChangeLog: added to distribution

	* configure.in: totally rewritten

	* config.h.in, conf.h.in: conf.h.in replaced by a totally
	  rewritten config.h.in.  Furthermore, config.h is now explicitly
 	  included in allmost every source file of the distribution.
	* factoryconf.template: new file. factoyconf.h is included instead
	  of config.h in all source files which are not translated but
 	  installed (e.g. templates).

	* factory.template, factory.h: factory.h replaced by
	  factory.template since makeheader is now included in
	  the distribution
	* factory.template: rewritten to new makeheader syntax

	* factory.template, singfactory.h: Singular stuff moved from
	  singfactory.h to factory.template.  Wrapped by #ifdef
	  SINGULAR.
	* singfactory.h: removed from distribution

	* gengftables.cc: code for generating gftables added to
	  distribution

	* GNUmakefile.in, Makefile.in: Makefile.in replaced by a totally
	  rewritten GNUmakefile.in

	* INSTALL: removed from distribution since not up to date

	* memman.h, mmalloc.c, mmallocs.c, mmheap.c, mmprivate.h,
	  mmutil.c, mmallocb.c, mmblock.c, mminit.c, mmspec.c: new memory
	  manager added to distribution

	* mpext.cc, mpext.h, mpfactory.h: removed from distribution.  No
	  more MP support.
	* config.h.in (MULTIPROTOCOL): #define MULTIPROTOCOL removed
	* int_int.h (class InternalInteger): declarations dependent on
	  #define MULTIPROTOCOL removed
	* int_rat.h (class InternalRational): declarations dependent on
	  #define MULTIPROTOCOL removed

	* readcf.cc: added to distribution since not all users have
	  bison available


	Now for the changes at organization level:
	If we refer to the "DEBOUT macros", the "ASSERT macros", or the
	"TIMING macros" we mean one (or more) of the macros defined in
	debug.h, assert.h, and timing.h, resp.

	* assert.h (NOASSERT, NDEBUG): #define NDEBUG to switch off
	  assertions replaced by #define NOASSERT.  For sake of backward
	  compatibility NDEBUG works, too.

	* assert.h (DEBINCLEVEL, DEBDECLEVEL, DEBOUTSL, DEBOUT, DEBOUTLN):
	  DEBOUT macros moved to debug.h
	* assert.cc: renamed to debug.cc
	* debug.h, debug.cc: new files.  DEBOUT macros moved from
	  assert.h/assert.cc to debug.h/debug.cc.  All source files which
 	  need these macros include debug.h.

	* assert.h (PVIRT_VOID, PVIRT_INTCF, PVIRT_BOOL, PVIRT_INT,
	  PVIRT_CHARCC): PVIRT_*-macros moved from int_cf.h to assert.h
	* int_cf.h (PVIRT_VOID, PVIRT_INTCF, PVIRT_BOOL, PVIRT_INT,
	  PVIRT_CHARCC): PVIRT_*-macros moved to assert.h

	* assert.h (__ASSERT, __STICKYASSERT): the preprocessor instead of
 	  fprintf() pastes the message into the format string now

	* assert.h (__ASSERT1, ASSERT1, STICKYASSERT1): new macros

	* assert.h (__WARN, WARN, STICKYWARN): new macros

	* canonicalform.cc (operator>>): dependency on #define SINGULAR
	  removed

	* cf_defs.h (INCL_CF_DEFS_H, incl_cf_defs_H): #define
	  incl_cf_defs_H renamed to #define INCL_CF_DEFS_H so
	  cf_defs.h is included only once

	* cf_factor.cc (factorize): dependency on #define MULTIFACTOR
	  removed

	* cf_factory.cc (CFFactory::basic( int, int )): error message
	  changed to call of ASSERT macros
	* fac_util.cc: (crossprod): error message changed to call of
	  ASSERT macros
	* int_cf.cc: several error messages changed to calls of ASSERT
	  macros
	* int_cf.h (InternalCF::InternalCF( InternalCF& )): error message
	  changed to call of ASSERT macros

	  message changed to call of ASSERT macros
	* templates/array.cc (Array<T>::operator[], Array<T>::operator+=):
	  error messages changed to calls of ASSERT macros
	* templates/list.cc (List<T>::getFirst, List<T>::getLast,
	  ListIterator<T>::getItem): error messages changed to calls of
	  ASSERT macros

	* cf_gcd.cc: debug output changed to calls of DEBOUT macros
	* cf_linsys.cc: debug output rewritten and changed to calls of
	  DEBOUT macros
	* fac_berlekamp.cc (QPrintFF, QPrintGF): definition and calls of
	  QPrintFF(), QPrintGF() wrapped by #ifdef DEBUGOUTPUT
	* fac_univar.cc: debug output rewritten
	  (hprint): calls to hprint() wrapped by calls to #define
 	  DEBOUTHPRINT, which definition depends on #define DEBUGOUTPUT
	  (instead of NDEBUG, as before).  All callers changed.

	* cf_linsys.cc: superfluous #define TIMING removed
	* fac_distrib.cc: superfluous #undef DEBUGOUTPUT removed
	* fac_ezgcd.cc: some superfluous #defines (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING)
	  and #includes removed
	* fac_multihensel.cc: some superfluous #defines (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING)
	  removed
	* fac_multivar.cc: some superfluous #defines (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING)
	  removed
	* fac_univar.cc: some superfluous #defines (DEBUGOUTPUT, TIMING)
	  and #includes removed

	* config.h.in (GFTABLEDIR): new #define
	* gfops.cc (gf_get_table): uses #define GFTABLEDIR to get path
	  to the GF(q) tables

	  #defines

	* config.h.in (NOSTREAMIO): new #define NOSTREAMIO to switch off
	  stream IO.  Operators <<, >>, and related stuff wrapped by
 	  #ifndef NOSTREAMIO.

	* debug.cc (deb_level, level_msg, deb_inc_level):
	  deb_inc_level()'s output made more pretty at time of first call

	* debug.h (DEBOUT, DEBOUTLN): slightly modified so they print
	  "objects" instead of only one "msg" and one "object".  All
 	  callers changed.

	* debug.h (DEBUGOUTPUT): #define DEBUGOUTPUT is switched off now
	  if #define NDEBUG is switched on

	* fac_univar.cc (ZFactorizeUnivariate): timing stuff changed to
	  calls of TIMING macros

	* gmpext.h: references to #define INCL_GCDEXT_H replaced by
	  references to #define INCL_GMPEXT_H

	* initgmp.cc (initializeGMP): dependency on #define SINGULAR
	  removed

	* mmallocb.c (MM_TEST, TEST): references to #define TEST
	  replaced by references to #define MM_TEST

	* readcf.h: '#include <stdio.h>' replaced by '#include <iostream.h>'

	* readcf.y: dependency on #define COMEAU removed

	* templates/matrix.cc (ASSERT): definition of ASSERT macros
	  replaced by inclusion of factoryconf.h

	* timing.h (HZ): new #define to calculate ticks per second in a

	* templates/matrix.h (Matrix<T>::T_ptr): new typedef
	* templates/matrix.cc (Matrix<T>::Matrix( int, int ),
	  Matrix<T>::Matrix( Matrix<T> ), Matrix<T>::operator=): 'new (T*)[..]'
