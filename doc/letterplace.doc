Let $V$ be a $K$-vector space, spanned by the symbols $x_1,\dots,x_n$.
Free associative algebra in $x_1,\dots,x_n$ over $K$, denoted by 
$K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$ is also known as a tensor algebra $T(V)$ of $V$.
It is an infinite dimensional $K$-vector space, where as a basis one can take
the elements of a free monoid $\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$. In other
words, the monomials of $K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$ are the words
of finite length in the finite alphabet $\{ x_1,\dots,x_n \}$. 
$K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$ is an integral domain, which is not
Noetherian for $n\geq 2$ (hence, a Groebner basis of an ideal might
be infinite). It can be regarded as a graded algebra in a natural way. 

Any finitely presented associative algebra is isomorphic to a
quotient of $K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$ modulo a certain
two-sided ideal.

We call a total ordering $<$ on $N := \langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$ a 
\textbf{monomial ordering} if the following conditions hold:

\begin{enumerate}
\item $<$ is a well-ordering on $N$, that is $1 < x$ $\ \forall x \in N$,
\item $\forall p,q,s,t \in N$, \; if $s<t$, then $p\cdot s \cdot q< p\cdot t \cdot q$,
\item $\forall p,q,s,t \in N$, \; if $s=p\cdot t \cdot q$ and $s\not=t$, then $t<s$.    
\end{enumerate}

Hence the notions of a leading monomial and coefficients transfer to this situation.
@c as they usually do

We say that a monomial $v$ divides monomial $w$, iff there exist monomials 
$p,s \in N$, such that $w = p \cdot w \cdot s$.

For a subset $G \subset T := K\langle x_1,\dots,x_n \rangle$, 
define a \textbf{leading ideal} of $G$ to be the two-sided ideal 
$L(G) \; = \; {}_{T} \langle$ $\; \{\lm(g) \;|\; g \in G\setminus\{0\} \}$ $\; \rangle_{T} \subseteq T$. 

Let $<$ be a fixed monomial ordering on $T$.
We say that a subset $G \subset I$ is a \textbf{(two-sided) Gr\"obner basis} for the ideal $I$ with respect to $<$, if $L(G) = L(I)$. That is $\forall f\in I$ there exists $g\in G$, such that
$\lm(g)$ divides $\lm(f)$.

@section Letterplace correspondence
@cindex letterplace correspondence

We utilize the ideas of Feynmann and Rota and encode
the monomials (words) of the free algebra 
$x_{i_1} x_{i_2} \dots x_{i_m} \in K\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ 
via the double-indexed letterplace 
(that is encoding the letter (= variable) and its place in the word) monomials
$x(i_1 | 1) x(i_2 | 2) \dots x(i_m | m) \in K[X\times \mathbb{N}]$, where $X=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$.

Note, that the latter letterplace algebra $K[X\times \mathbb{N}]$ is infinitely generated. 
Since $K\langle x_1,\ldots,x_n \rangle$ is not Noetherian, it is common to perform
the computations up to a given degree. In that case the truncated letterplace 
algebra is finitely generated commutative ring.

Indeed, there is 1-to-1 correspondence between graded two-sided ideals
of a free algebra and so-called letterplace ideals in the letterplace algebra, see [LL].
All the computations take place in the latter algebra. A letterplace ideal
is a subset of a special vector space $V$, which is spanned by all letterplace
monomials. A letterplace monomial of length $m$ is a monomial of
a letterplace algebra, such that its $m$ places are exactly $1,2,\ldots,m$. 
That is a multilinearity wrt places take place.

@section Example of use of @sc{Letterplace}

The input monomials must be given in a letterplace notation. We recommend
first to define a commutative ring $K[X]$ in @sc{Singular} and equip it with
a degree well-ordering. Then, decide what should be the degree bound $d$ and
run the procedure \texttt{freegbRing(d)} from the library \texttt{freegb.lib}.
This procedure creates a letterplace algebra with an induced ordering.
In this algebra, define the ideal $I$ in the letterplace encoding and run the procedure
\texttt{system("freegb",I,d,n)}, where $n$ is the number of variables of
the original commutative ring. The output is given in the letterplace encoding.

We illustrate this approach with the following example:

\begin{verbatim}
LIB "freegb.lib";
ring r = 0,(x,y,z),dp;
int d =4; // degree bound
def R = freegbRing(d);
setring R;
ideal I = x(1)*y(2) + y(1)*z(2), x(1)*x(2) + x(1)*y(2) - y(1)*x(2) - y(1)*y(2);
option(redSB);option(redTail);
ideal J = system("freegb",I,d,nvars(r));
J;
\end{verbatim}

It is possible to convert the letterplace presentation of an ideal
to a list of strings with the help of procedures \texttt{lp2lstr} and \texttt{lst2str} from
the library \texttt{freegb.lib}. Let us continue with the example above: 

\begin{verbatim}
  lp2lstr(J,r); // export an object called LN to the ring r
  setring r;  // change to the ring r
  lst2str(LN,1); // output the string presentation
\end{verbatim}

There are various conversion routines in the library \texttt{freegb.lib}.
We work further on implementing more algorithms for 
non-commutative ideals and modules over free associative algebra.

@node Release notes,  , Example of use of Letterplace
@section Release notes of @sc{Letterplace}

With this functionality it is possible to compute two-sided Groebner basis
of a grade two-sided ideal (that is, generated by homogeneous polynomials) 
in a free associative algebra up to a given degree.
 
Restrictions of the @sc{Letterplace} package: 
@itemize
@item At the moment we provide stable algorithm for the homogeneous input only, 
computations with inhomogeneous ideals are under development.
@item Since free algebra is not Noetherian, one has to define an explicit degree bound,
up to which a partial Groebner basis will be computed.
@item the options \texttt{option(redSB);option(redTail);} must be always activated
@item we advise to run the computations with the options  \texttt{option(prot);option(mem);}
in order to see the activity journal as well as the memory usage
