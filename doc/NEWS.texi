The current version @value{VERSION} is a pre-release to the new
release series version 3-0. 

Singular version 3 has a greater functionality and an improved architecture.
Major new features are:
@itemize
@item
dynamic modules
@item
non-commutative extensions (plural)
@item
name spaces (package)
@item
easy manipulation of rings (ringlist)
@item
improved speed of maps (subst, map)
@item
improved factorization (integration of NTL, factorization over algebraic extensions,
zeroset.lib)
@item
improved gcd of polynomials (including bug fixes)
@item
ports to more architectures including automatic building from source (fink on Mac, ebuild on Gentoo)
@item
more help browser supported, user extendable (help.cnf)
@item
many bugs fixed
@end itemize
Besides theses internal changes, Singular version 3 offers many new
features and functionalities (which were partly already incorporated in
the 2-0 series).

@heading Factorizing algorithms revisited
Starting with version 2-0-4, we use NTL (of Victor Shoup) for factoring
univariate polynomials. The multivariate factoring code in libfac/factory
does now also work over algebraic extension fields.

@heading New @sc{Singular} libraries

Reorganisation of libraries into "Categories".
