The version 3-0-0 is the first in the new
release series version 3-0. 

Singular version 3 has a greater functionality and an improved architecture.
Major new features are:
@itemize
@item
@nref{Dynamic modules}

non-commutative extension @nref{Non-commutative subsystem PLURAL}
@item
name spaces (@nref{package})

@item
a new algorithm for Groebner base computations: @nref{slimgb}.
@item
improved factorization (integration of NTL, factorization over algebraic extensions,
zeroset.lib)
@item
improved gcd of polynomials (including bug fixes)
@item
ports to more architectures including automatic building from source (fink on Mac, ebuild on Gentoo)

the 2-1 pre-release series).

@heading Factorizing algorithms revisited
Starting with version 2-0-4, we use NTL (of Victor Shoup) for factoring
univariate polynomials. The multivariate factorization code in libfac/factory
now also works over algebraic extension fields.
