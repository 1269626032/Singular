The current version @value{VERSION} is an alpha-release of the upcoming
new release version 2-0 (should be there at the beginning of
2000). Items labeled with "TBC" in this news file are features which
still have to be implemented and/or documented.

Although there are no known bugs, it is to be
expected that the current version @value{VERSION} is not as stable as
the 1.2 version(s), since major changes were done to the @sc{Singular}
kernel. Therefore, it is important to us, that users try out this new
version.

Furthermore, the current version is generally not yet as fast as version 
1.2. But this is going to change dramatically in the upcoming release
version(s). 

Thank you very much for your support!

@heading Internal Changes
@table @asis
@item new data structures for monomials and polynomials
Makes polynomial arithmetic significantly faster. Especially for block - 
or weighted orderings. TBC: Faster polynomial arithmetic for orderings
(like dp, or lp). TBC: Bucket representation of polynomials in std; TBC: 
DegBound during std computations.
@item new memory management
Results is less memory usage, faster memory allocation/free, less
fragmentation, much better locality of reference.
