@heading News for version @value{VERSION}

Version 4-0-0 is a milestone relase of Singular.
The new release series 4 aims for an entirely modularized system
simplifying connectivity with other systems and paving the way
for parallel computations.
As one step in this direction, in Singular 4-0-0, 
the representation of coefficient rings has been separated from the representation
of polynomials which allows for easy integration of new types of coefficient fields.

@sc{Singular} 4-0-0's list of improvements and new
functionality further extends that of 
the 3-1-6/7 pre-release series.
One highlight is the implementation
of Walther's algorithm for computing deRham cohomology.
