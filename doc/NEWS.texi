The current version @value{VERSION} is a pre-release to the new
release series version 3-0. 

Singular version 3 has a greater functionality and an improved architecture.
Major new features are:
@itemize
@item
dynamic modules
@item
non-commutative extension @nref{PLURAL}
@item
name spaces (package)
@item
easy manipulation of rings (ringlist)
@item
improved speed of maps (subst, map)
@item
variant of Faugeres F4: @nref{slimgb}.
@item
improved factorization (integration of NTL, factorization over algebraic extensions,
zeroset.lib)
@item
improved gcd of polynomials (including bug fixes)
@item
ports to more architectures including automatic building from source (fink on Mac, ebuild on Gentoo)
@item
more help browser supported, user extendable (help.cnf)
@item
many bugs fixed
@end itemize
Besides theses internal changes, Singular version 3 offers many new
features and functionalities (which were partly already incorporated in
the 2-0 series).

@heading Factorizing algorithms revisited
Starting with version 2-0-4, we use NTL (of Victor Shoup) for factoring
univariate polynomials. The multivariate factoring code in libfac/factory
does now also work over algebraic extension fields.

@heading Noncommutative Extension @sc{Plural}

Starting with version 3-0-0, @sc{Singular} features a
noncommutative extension @sc{Plural}. It allows to 
set and to compute within noncommutative algebras
 with PBW basis. Among available algorithms are Groebner
bases for left modules, syzygies and resolutions.

Together with @sc{Plural} come the following libraries:

@table @asis
@item @nref{center_lib}
computes generators of the center and centralizer subalgebras up
to a given degree resp. up to a given number of generators
@item @nref{involution_lib}
determines linear antiautomorphisms (involutions) and automorphisms
@item @nref{gkdim_lib}
computes a Gel'fand-Kirillov dimension for modules
@item @nref{ncalg_lib}
includes ready-to-use funtions for defining many important
 noncommutative algebras
@item @nref{ncdecomp_lib}
computes a decomposition of module by its central characters
@item @nref{ncalg_lib}, @nref{nctools_lib}
contain numerous useful tools for noncommutative algebras
@item @nref{qmatrix_lib}
procedures, related to quantum matrices and minors
@end table

@heading Internal Changes
@table @asis
@item new mapping code
@c @item non-commutative extension (Plural)
@item factory revisited
(gcd, factorizing polynomial over algebraic extension fields,...)
@end table

@heading Porting
