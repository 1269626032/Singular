The current version @value{VERSION} is the first in the new
release series version 3-0. 

Singular version 3 has a greater functionality and an improved architecture.
Major new features are:
@itemize
@item
@nref{Dynamic modules}
@item
non-commutative extension @nref{PLURAL}
@item
name spaces (@nref{package})
@item
easy manipulation of rings (@nref{ringlist})
@item
improved speed of maps (@nref{subst}, @nref{map})
@item
variant of Faugeres F4: @nref{slimgb}.
@item
improved factorization (integration of NTL, factorization over algebraic extensions,
zeroset.lib)
@item
improved gcd of polynomials (including bug fixes)
@item
ports to more architectures including automatic building from source (fink on Mac, ebuild on Gentoo)
@item
more help browsers supported, user extendable (help.cnf)
@item
better support of graded modules
@item
many bugs fixed
@end itemize
Besides theses internal changes, Singular version 3 offers many new
features and functionalities (which were partly already incorporated in
the 2-1 pre-release series).

@heading Factorizing algorithms revisited
Starting with version 2-0-4, we use NTL (of Victor Shoup) for factoring
univariate polynomials. The multivariate factorization code in libfac/factory
now also works over algebraic extension fields.

@heading New @sc{Singular} libraries

@end table

@heading Changes in @sc{Singular} libraries
Many procedures were moved into different libraries,
the documentation of libraries was generally improved.

All procedures which used to change the current ring return now
the newly created ring.

@table @asis
@item @nref{ringlist}
manipulation of rings
@item @nref{slimgb}
variant of the F4 algorithm to compute Groebner bases
@item @nref{exportto}

@table @asis
@item @nref{degree}

@end table

@heading Noncommutative Extension @sc{Plural}

Starting with version 3-0-0, @sc{Singular} features a
noncommutative extension @sc{Plural}. It allows to 
set and to compute within noncommutative algebras
 with PBW basis. Among available algorithms are Groebner
bases for left modules, syzygies and resolutions.

Together with @sc{Plural} come the following libraries:

@table @asis
@item @nref{center_lib}
computes generators of the center and centralizer subalgebras up
to a given degree resp. up to a given number of generators
@item @nref{involution_lib}
determines linear antiautomorphisms (involutions) and automorphisms
@item @nref{gkdim_lib}
computes a Gel'fand-Kirillov dimension for modules
@item @nref{ncalg_lib}
includes ready-to-use funtions for defining many important
 noncommutative algebras
@item @nref{ncdecomp_lib}
computes a decomposition of module by its central characters
@item @nref{ncalg_lib}, @nref{nctools_lib}
contain numerous useful tools for noncommutative algebras
@item @nref{qmatrix_lib}
procedures, related to quantum matrices and minors
@end table

@heading Internal Changes
@table @asis
@item new mapping code
@c @item non-commutative extension (Plural)
@item factory revised
(gcd, factorizing polynomial over algebraic extension fields,...)
@end table

@heading Porting
