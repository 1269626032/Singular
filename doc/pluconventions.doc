@c The following directives are necessary for proper compilation
@c with emacs (C-c C-e C-r).  Please keep it as it is.  Since it
@c is wrapped in `@ignore' and `@end ignore' it does not harm `tex' or
@c `makeinfo' but is a great help in editing this file (emacs
@c ignores the conditionals).

@table @strong
@item @strong{What is @sc{Plural}?} @strong{What @sc{Plural} does?}

@sc{Plural} is a kernel extension of @sc{Singular},
providing many algorithms for computations within certain noncommutative algebras
@* (see see @ref{G-algebras} and @ref{Mathematical background @value{PSUFFIX}} for detailed information on algebras and algorithms).

@sc{Plural} is compatible with @sc{Singular}, since it uses the
same data structures, sometimes interpreting them in a different way
@* and/or modifying them for its own purposes. 
In spite of such a difference, one can always transfer 
objects from commutative rings of @sc{Singular} 
to noncommutative rings @sc{Plural} and back.



With @sc{Plural}, one can set up a noncommutative G-algebra with
a PBW basis, say, @math{A} (see @ref{G-algebras} for step-by-step building instruction and also @ref{PLURAL libraries} 
for procedures, setting many important algebras easily).

Functionalities of @sc{Plural} (enlisted in @ref{Functions  @value{PSUFFIX}}) are accessible as soon as the basering becomes noncommutative (see @ref{ncalgebra}).

One can perform various computations with polynomials and ideals in @math{A},
vectors and submodules of a free module
@tex
$A^n$.
@end tex
@ifinfo
A^n.
@end ifinfo

One can work also within factor-algebras of G-algebras (see @ref{qring} type)
by two-sided ideals (see @ref{twostd}).

@end itemize
@end table

@table @strong
@item @strong{What @sc{Plural} does not:}
@itemize 

@item @sc{Plural} does not perform computations neither in free algebra
nor in its general factor algebras.

One can only input and work with G-algebras and with their factor-algebras
by two-sided ideals.

@item @sc{Plural} does not work with local and mixed orderings

Right now, one can use only global orderings in @sc{Plural}
(see @ref{General definitions for orderings}). 

This will be enhaced in future by providing the possibility of computations in a tensor product of a noncommutative algebra (with a global ordering)
@* with a commutative algebra (with any ordering).

@item @sc{Plural} does not handle noncommutative parameters

Defining parameters, one @strong{can not} impose noncommutative relations
on them. Moreover, it is impossible to introduce 
@* parameters which do not commute with variables.

@item *-multiplication  @value{PSUFFIX}
@itemize 

in the noncommutative case, the correct multiplication of @code{y} by
 @code{x} must be written as @code{y*x}. 
@* Both expressions @code{yx} and @code{xy} are equal, since they are 
interpreted as commutative expressions. See example in @ref{poly expressions @value{PSUFFIX}}. 

@end itemize

@item   @code{ideal} @value{PSUFFIX}
@itemize
                        
Under an @code{ideal} @sc{Plural} understands a list of generators
of a @strong{left} ideal. For more information see @ref{ideal @value{PSUFFIX}}.
 @* For a @strong{two-sided ideal} @code{T}, use command @ref{twostd} in order to compute
the two-sided Groebner basis of @code{T}.
@c ( at the same time it is a left Groebner basis).
@end itemize

@item @code{module} @value{PSUFFIX}
@itemize
Under a @code{module} @sc{Plural} understands 
@strong{either} a fininitely generated @strong{left} submodule of a free module (of finite rank) 
@* @strong{or} a factor module of a free module (of finite rank) by its left submodule (see @ref{module @value{PSUFFIX}} for details).
