@comment this file contains the "Platform and pittfals" sections

@c The following directives are necessary for proper compilation
@c with emacs (C-c C-e C-r).  Please keep it as it is.  Since it
@c is wrapped in `@ignore' and `@end ignore' it does not harm `tex' or
@c `makeinfo' but is a great help in editing this file (emacs
@c ignores the `@ignore').
