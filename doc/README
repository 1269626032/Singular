To download SINGULAR for a Unix platform
========================================

Make sure that you have approximately 12MByte of free disk space and
follow these steps.

  1. You need to download two (archive) files:
    `Singular-1-3-7-share.tgz'
          contains architecture independent data like documentation and
          libraries (alternatively, you may also download
          `Singular-1-3-7-share.zip').

    `Singular-1-3-7-<uname>.tgz'
          contains architecture dependent executables, like the SINGULAR
          program.  `<uname>' is a description of the processor and
     operating system for which SINGULAR is compiled. Choose one of the
     following:
     `ix86-Linux'  PC's running under Linux                               
     `HPUX-9'      HP workstations running under HPUX version 9           
     `HPUX-10'     HP workstations running under HPUX version 10          
     Please contact us if you can not find an appropriate architecture
     dependent archive.

  2. Simply change to the directory in which you wish to install
     SINGULAR (usually wherever you install 3rd-party software):
          cd /usr/local/

     SINGULAR specific subdirectories will be created in such a way
     that multiple versions and multiple architecture dependent files
     of SINGULAR can peaceably coexist under the same `/usr/local/'
     tree.

  3. Unpack the archives:
          gzip -dc Singular-1-3-7-<uname>.tgz | tar -pxf -
          gzip -dc Singular-1-3-7-share.tgz | tar -pxf -
     If you have downloaded `Singular-1-3-7-share.zip', unpack with
          unzip -u Singular-1-3-7-share.zip

  4. After unpacking, see the created file `Singular/1-3-7/INSTALL' for
     details on how to finish the installation.
