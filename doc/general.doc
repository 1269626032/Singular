@subsection How to enter and exit
@cindex How to enter and exit

@*To start @sc{Singular}, enter @code{Singular} at the system prompt.
@*You will get a header with the version name, the compilation date
and a short remark how to get help on
@sc{Singular}.
Enter @code{help;} to get the online manual at the @sc{Singular} prompt
@code{>}.
Commands are always ended with a @code{;} (semicolon) and @code{<ENTER>}.
Spaces and commas are always considered as separators. 
@*To exit @sc{Singular} enter @code{quit;}, @code{exit;} or @code{$}.


@sc{Singular} may also be started with command-line options and with 
filenames as arguments. More generally, the synopsis of @sc{Singular} is
@*@code{  Singular  [options] [file1 [file2 ...]] }
@ref{Commandline options}
@menu
* Commandline options::
@end menu

@*On start-up, @sc{Singular} 
@enumerate
@item 
loads the library @code{standard.lib} (provided the @code{--no-stdlib}
was not given)

@item
searches the current directory and then the
home directory of the user for a file named @code{.singularrc} and
executes it, if found (provided the @code{--no-rc} options was not
given)

@item 
executes the files @code{file1}, @code{file2} ...  (given on the command
line) in that order. 
@end enumerate

Unless otherwise specified, @sc{Singular} locates all (data) files and
libraries by first searching for them in the current working directory,
and then by searching through all the directories specified by the
environment variable @code{SINGULARPATH} (@code{SPATH} on DOS-based
systems) and finally by searching through some default directories
(e.g., @code{/usr/local/share/Singular}).

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------
@node Singular prompt and error recovery,The online help system,How to enter and exit, Interactive use
@subsection Singular prompt and error recovery
@cindex Singular prompt and error recovery
@cindex prompt
@cindex error recovery
The @sc{Singular} prompt @code{>}
asks the user for input of a command, while the prompt @code{.}
asks the user for input of missing parts of a command (remember the
semicolon @code{;} at the end of every command). If your input
is erroneous @sc{Singular} may miss the semicolon.
(It may be missed because @code{Singular} needs first a @code{"} or @code{@}}.)
On the other hand additional @code{;} will not harm @sc{Singular}:
extra semicolons are interpreted as empty statements.

If the command line option @code{-t} is not given,
@sc{Singular} redefines the terminal characteristics
@footnote{
therefore the comandline option @code{-t} must be given if @sc{Singular} should
run in the background
}
and the following keys can be used for editing
the input and retrieving previous input lines
(CTL denotes the control key):
@table @kbd
@item CTL-A
goto to the start of the line
@item CTL-B
go one character to the left
@item CTL-D
erase the character under the cursor
(or return @kbd{EOF}, if the current line is empty)
@item CTL-E
goto to the end of the line
@item CTL-F
go one character to the right
@item BACKSPACE
@itemx DELETE
@itemx CTL-H
erase the character before the cursor
@item CTL-K
kill the rest of the line
@item CTL-N
save the current line to the history and get the next line
@item CTL-P
save the current line to the history and get the previous line
@item CTL-U

@item RETURN
save the current line to the history and
send it to the Singular parser for interpretation

@node Control parameters, Startup sequence, Editing Input, Interactive use
@subsection Control parameters
@cindex Control parameters

You may wish to set some control parameters. Most often used are
@code{timer}, @code{option(prot)} and @code{pagewidth}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
If @code{timer} is set to 1 the time (in sec) used for the execution of
a command
is displayed if it is bigger than 0.5 sec (Unix: CPU-time
or Macintosh/MSDOS: time between two commands).
@item
@code{option(prot)} shows a short protocol during std-computation: the
number between brackets () is the number of critical pairs still
to be reduced (except immediatly after an H 'high corner' where it shows the
degree above which all monomials can be discarded), a - sign indicates
that one critical pair has been reduced (either to 0 or to a new
s-polynomial which indicated by an s), a number without brackets
shows the degree in which the computation takes place (this is in
particular useful if the input is homogeneous).
There are many more options, mostly used to control the strategies
for the std-computations, see the manual or type @code{help option;}.
@item
@code{pagewidth} sets the number of characters in a line printed on the
screen.
@item
verbose controls messages like warnings, loading libs, etc., see the
manual or type @code{help verbose;}.
@end itemize

@example
pagewidth = 80;        // set pagewidth to 80 characters
option(prot);          // short protocoll
timer = 1;             // activate the timer
verbose(noredefine);   // supress redefine-warnings
@end example

It is useful to have a file say, init, in which your preferred
parameters are set. Such a file could also contain the commands
for loading those libraries which you usually use. If you start
by typing '@code{Singular init}' the @code{init} file and hence all commands
contained in @code{init} are executed.

@*with the options (which can be given in both, their long and
short format):
@table @asis

@item @code{-b},@code{--batch} 
Run in MP batch mode. Opens a TCP/IP connection with host specified by
@code{--MPhost} at the port specified by @code{--MPport}. Input is read
from and output is written to this connection in the MP format.

@item @code{-h},@code{--help} 
Print a short help message and exit.

@item @code{-q},@code{--quiet}
Do not print start-up banner and warnings and redirect stderr (all error
messages)  to stdout (normal output channel).

@item @code{-t},@code{--no-tty} 
Do not redefine the terminal characteristics (useful for batch
processes, see @ref{Editing Input}).  

@item @code{-v},@code{--version}             
Print extended information about the version and configuration of
@sc{Singular}  (used optional parts, compilation date, start of random
generator etc.). This information should be included if a user reports
an error to the authors.

@item @code{-e},@code{--echo[=VAL]} 
Set value of variable @code{echo} to @code{VAL} (integer in the range 0
.. 9). Without an argument, @code{echo} is set to 1, which echoes all
input coming from a file. By default, the value of @code{echo} is 0. See
also @ref{System variables}.

@item @code{-c},@code{--execute=STRING} 
Execute @code{STRING} as a (sequence) of @sc{Singular} commands on
start-up after the @code{.singularrc} file is executed, but prior to
executing the files given on the command line.

@item @code{-r},@code{--random=SEED}         
Seed (i.e., set initial value of) pseudo random generator with integer
(integer) @code{SEED} (integer). If this option is not given, then the
random generated is seeded with a time-based @code{SEED} (e.g., the
number of seconds since January, 1, 1970, on Unix systems).

@item @code{-u},@code{--user-option=STRING}
Returns @code{STRING} on @code{system("--user-option")}. This is useful
for passing arbitrary arguments (like filenames) from the command line to 
the @sc{Singular} interpreter (i.e. top-level of @sc{Singular}).

@item @code{--no-stdlib}
Do not load the library @code{standard.lib} on start-up. By default,
this library is loaded on start-up.

@item @code{--no-rc}               
Do not execute the @code{.singularrc} file on start-up. By default,
@sc{Singular} searches first in the current directory and then in the
home directory of the user for a file named @code{.singularrc}. If it is 
found, then it is executed after the library @code{standard.lib} is
loaded and prior to executing the string specified by
@code{--user-option}.

@item @code{--min-time=SECS}
If the @code{timer} variables is set, do only report times larger than
@code{SECS} seconds (@code{SECS} needs to be a floating point number
greater than 0). By default, this value is set to 0.5 (i.e., half a
second).

@item @code{--MPport=PORT} 
Use @code{PORT} as default port number for MP connections (whenever not
further specified) . This option is mandatory when the @code{--batch}
option is given. See also @ref{MPtcp links}.

@item @code{--MPhost=HOST}
Use @code{HOST} as default host for MP connections (whenever not
further specified) . This option is mandatory when the @code{--batch}
option is given. See also @ref{MPtcp links}.

@item @code{--ticks-per-sec=TICKS} 
Sets unit of timer to @code{TICKS} per second (i.e. the value reported by 
the @code{timer} variable multiplied by @code{TICKS} gives the time in
seconds.By default, this value is 1.

@subsection Available rings
@cindex Available rings
The most basic (and most complicated) object in @sc{Singular}
is a @code{ring} (and @code{qring}). Each object of type
@code{poly},
@code{ideal},
@code{vector},
@code{module},
@code{map},
@code{matrix},
@code{number}
belongs to a specific ring.
Also @code{list}, if one of the objects belong to a ring.
These objects are local to the ring, hence their names can be used for other
objects in other rings. Objects from one ring can be mapped to another
ring with an object of type @code{map}
(or with the commands @code{fetch} or @code{imap}).
The rings which are available in @sc{Singular} are described in
@ref{Baserings and ground fields}. They are all algebras over the ground
field. Hence, in oder to compute in one of the ground fields,
one has to define a ring (with at least one variable and a monomial
ordering).

The other types do not belong to a ring and can be accessed within every ring.

@node Term orderings, ,General syntax of a ring definition, Rings and orderings
@subsection Term orderings
@cindex Term orderings

The most important term orderings or monomial orderings in @sc{Singular} are:
@*global or p-orderings: @code{lp, dp, wp, Dp, Wp} refer to a polynomial ring,
@*local or s-orderings: @code{ls, ds, ws, Ds, Ws} refer to a series ring,
@*matrix orderings: allow to create any ordering by a matrix,
@*product (or block) orderings of the above.

Given such an ordering say, ord, the ring r created by
@*@center @code{ring r = p,x(1..n),ord;}
@*
@tex
is by definition Loc K$[x_1,...,x_n]$, where K=Z/p and Loc denotes
localization with respect to the muliplicatively closed set
$$\{ 1+f | lead(f) < 1 \}.$$
Here lead means the leading monomial with respect to ord, 1
is the constant monomial 1 and $>$ means bigger with respect to
ord. For global orderings, $x_i > 1$, hence Loc K$[x_1,...,x_n]$ =
K$[x_1,...,x_n]$, for local orderings, $x_i < 1$, hence LocK$[x_1,...,x_n]$ =
Loc$_{(x)}$K[$x_1,...,x_n$] (= localization of K[$x_1,...,x_n$] with
respect to the maximal ideal $(x_1,...,x_n)$).
A product ordering which is for example
of the form (s-ordering(k),p-ordering(l)), n=k+l, (the variables
$x1,...,xk$ being s-ordered, $x_{k+1},...,x_n$ p-ordered) creates
           Loc$_(x)$K[$x_1,...,x_k] \otimes $K[$x_{k+1},...,x_n$].
Many other rings between the polynomial ring and the power
series ring are realized by the choice of an ordering.

@ifinfo
is by definition Loc K[x(1),...,x(n)], where K=Z/p and Loc denotes

@*@center @{ 1+f | lead(f) < 1 @}.
@*Here lead means the leading monomial with respect to ord, 1
is the constant monomial 1 and > means bigger with respect to
ord. For global orderings, x(i) > 1, hence Loc K[x(1),...,x(n)] =
K[x(1),...,x(n)], for local orderings, x(i) < 1, hence LocK[x(1),...,x(n)] =
Loc_(x)K[x(1),...,x(n)] (= localization of K[x(1),...,x(n)] with respect to the
maximal ideal (x(1),...,x(n))). A product ordering which is for example
of the form (s-ordering(k),p-ordering(l)), n=k+l, (the variables
x(1),...,x(k) being s-ordered, x(k+1),...,x(n) p-ordered) creates
           Loc_(x)K[x(1),...,x(k)] tensor K[x(k+1),...,x(n)].
Many other rings between the polynomial ring and the power
series ring are realized by the choice of an ordering.
@end ifinfo

The great variety of differnt orderings and their efficient
implementation makes @sc{Singular} a powerful tool for many different tasks
in Algebraic Geometry, Algebra and Singularity theory.

On the other hand it requires careful thinking about the 'correct'
ordering for a specific task. Even if the rings are the same,
the result of a standard basis computation depends on the
ordering. For instance, the commands dim, mult, degree, hilb,
etc. compute the dimension, multiplicity, etc. of the ideal
generated by the leading terms of the given generators. In
many cases of interest, e.g. if a degree-ordering is choosen
and if the generators are a standard basis, the computed
result will be the corresponding invariant of the ideal itself.
Nevertheless, it remains the task of the user to give a correct
interpretation of the result.

A standard mistake is to interprete degree(i) or mult(i) for an
inhomogeneous ideal i as the degree of the homogenisation or
as something like the 'degree of the affine part'. For the
ordering dp (degree reverse lexicographical) the converse is
true: if i is given by a standard basis, mult(i) is the degree
of the homogeneous ideal obtained by homogenisation of i and
then putting the homogenizing variable to 0, hence it is the
degree of the part at infinity.
(Check this by looking at the initial ideal.)

A monomial ordering (term ordering) on $K[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ is
a total ordering $<$ on the
set of monomials (power products) $\{x^\alpha|\alpha \in \bf{N}^n\}$
which is compatible with the
natural semigroup structure, i.e.\ $x^\alpha < x^\beta$ implies $x^\gamma
x^\alpha < x^\gamma x^\beta$ for any $\gamma \in \bf{N}^n$.

If $K$ is the groundfield, $x = (x_1, \ldots, x_n)$ the

localization of $K[x]$ with respect to the multiplicatively closed set $\{1 +
g \mid g = 0$ or $g \in K[x]\backslash \{0\}$ and $L(g) < 1\}$.   $L(g)$
denotes the leading monomial of $g$, i.e.\ the biggest monomial of $g$ with
