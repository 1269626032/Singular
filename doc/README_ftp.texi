@c FILE: README_download.texi
@c PURPOSE: This should reside as README file in the main directory of the
@c          Singular ftp site.

@ifclear VERSION
@include version.texi
@end ifclear


@majorheading Welcome to the Development FTP site of SINGULAR

The new @sc{Singular} version @value{VERSION} which can be downloaded from
this directory is an alpha-release of the upcoming
new release version 2-0 (should be there at the beginning of
2000). 

@macro nref{name,url}
@ifhtml
@item @uref{\url\,,\name\}
@end ifhtml
@ifnothtml
@item @code{\name\}
@end ifnothtml
@end macro

In this directory you find the following files:
@table @asis
@nref{NEWS, NEWS.html}
news and changes of this version
@nref{COPYING, COPYING.html}
license information for @sc{Singular}
@nref{INSTALL_unix, INSTALL_unix.html}
Unix installation instructions
@item @code{Singular-@value{VERSION}-share.tgz}
@sc{Singular} distribution archive which contains architecture
independent data like documentation and libraries.
@item @code{Singular-@value{VERSION}-<uname>}.tgz
@sc{Singular} distribution archives which contain architecture dependent
executables, like the @sc{Singular} program.
@end table

Although there are no known bugs, it is to be
expected that the current version @value{VERSION} is not as stable as
the 1.2 version(s), since major changes were done to the @sc{Singular}
kernel. Therefore, it is important to us, that users try out this new
version and tell us what they think about it. Thank you very much in
advance for your support.
