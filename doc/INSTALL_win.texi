@end ifclear

To install @sc{Singular} on a PC running Windows 95/98/NT/2K, you need
to download @emph{one} of the following three archive files:

@table @code
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Compact. exe
Minimal archive to download. Installs Singular and minimal set of needed
tools/DLLs.
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Typical. exe
Typical archive to download. Installs Singular and the XEmacs editor to
run ESingular.
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Custom. exe
Maximal archive to download. Installs Singular, XEmacs, and many Cygwin
development tools (like gcc, gdb, make, perl, etc).
@end table

You can obtain these (and other) archives from
@display
@uref{ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/Development}.

@heading To install SINGULAR

@enumerate
@item
If you have Cygwin B19 or B20 installed on your
system, then uninstall it. Especially make sure that you delete the
@code{/} and @code{/bin} mount points (i.e., execute the commands @code{umount
/} and @code{umount /bin} before deleting the installed Cygwin
programs).
@item 
If you have Cygwin version 1.0 or higher installed on your system, you
should either delete it, or, do not install the Cygwin component contained
in the @sc{Singular} installation archives.
@item 
If you are running Windows NT/2000, make sure that you are logged on as
@code{Administrator}.
@item
Execute the self-extracting archive (e.g., double-click on it) and
@strong{carefully} follow the instructions given there.
@item 
When asked for the installation folder, you should simply choose a drive
(you may choose a subfolder, but this is not as convenient as a drive).
@strong{Important:} If you have Cygwin already installed on your system, 
make sure that the folder you choose is mounted to the root of your
(Cygwin) file system.
@* Among others, the folowing subfolders will be created:
@itemize @code
@item bin
contains the basic cygwin DLLs and tools
@item etc
contains miscellanous configuration and documentation file (like a FAQ
and README file)
@item tmp
for temporary files
@item usr
contains subfolders which contain the @sc{Singular} and XEmacs program and
documentation.
@end itemize
@item
When asked for the Setup Type, choose @code{Typical}, unless you know
what you are doing. 
@* If you choose @code{Compact}, the XEmacs editor is
excluded from the installation. 
@* If you choose @code{Custom}, make sure that you do @emph{not}
de-select the @code{BasicCygwin} component, unless you already have
Cygwin version 1.0   (or higher) installed on your system. 
@* If you have the @emph{Cygwin} port of XEmacs version 21.1.10 (or higher)
already installed on your system, you can safely de-selct the
@code{XEmacs} component. All other version of Emacs (resp. XEmacs) have
some quirks and do not work right together with @sc{Singular} (i.e.,
running @code{Esingular} results in problems).
@* You only should install the @code{AdditionalCygwin} component, if you 
plan on doing some software-develpment with cygwin. This component
contains, among others, the gcc compiler, gdb debugger, a cygwin port of 
perl, the cvs version control system, and many other
software-development tools and libraries (you basically get what we use
as our environment for building @sc{Singular}). 
@item 
At the end, you @emph{should} reboot your computer. Otherwise, some
