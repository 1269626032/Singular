@heading Installation preliminaries

To run @sc{Singular} on MSWINDOWS requires that the Cygwin DLL
(dynamically linked library) version 1.0 or higher is installed on your
system (see @uref{???} for details about 
Cygwin).

To run @sc{ESingular} (i.e. @sc{Singular} within its Emacs interface) on
MSWINDOWS requires furthermore that the (X)Emacs editor is installed on
your system.

Therefore, the @sc{Singular} installation is devided into the following
components: 
@table @code
@item Singular-@value{version}
Contains the @sc{Singular} program and all documentation and example
files.
@*All files of this component are installed under the directory
@code{/usr/local/Singular/@value{VERSION}/}
@item BasicCygwin
Contains the Cygwin DLL and basic tools/programs (like @code{bash} or
@code{info}) of the  Cygwin environment.
@*The Cygwin DLL and programs are installed in the directory
@code{/bin}. Miscellanous documentation and configuration files are
installed into the directory @code{/etc}.
@item Xemacs-21.10
Contains the Cygwin port of the Xemacs editor (see
@url{http://www.xemacs.org} for more about XEmacs) version 21.10. 
@*All files of this component are installed under the directory
@code{/usr/local}.
@item AdditionalCygwin
Contains additional Cygwin development tools (like @code{gcc},
@code{gdb}, @code{make}, @code{perl}, etc). Roughly speaking, togehter
with the @code{BasicCygwin} component, this component contains the
development environment we use to build/compile/develop @sc{Singular}
under MSWINDOWS.
@*Most of the programs of this component are installed into the
directories @code{/bin} or @code{/usr/local/bin}.
@table

@heading Downloading preliminaries

To install @sc{Singular} on a PC running Windows 95/98/NT/2K, you need
to download @emph{one} of the following three archive files:

@table @code
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Compact.exe
Minimal archive to download. Contains the @code{BasicCygwin} and
@code{Singular-@value{VERSION}} components.
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Typical.exe
Typical archive to download. Contains the @code{BasicCygwin},
@code{Singular-@value{VERSION}} and @code{XEmacs-21.10} components.
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Custom.exe
Maximal archive to download. Contains the @code{BasicCygwin},
@code{Singular-@value{VERSION}}, @code{XEmacs-21.10} and
@code{AdditionalCygwin} components.
@end table

@ignore
@c later, only Singular updates should be possible
@item Singular-@value{VERSION}-Only.exe
Minimal archive to download. Contains only the  component. 
@end ignore

You can obtain these (and other) archives from
@display
@uref{ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/Development}.

@heading To install SINGULAR

@enumerate
@item
If you have Cygwin B19 or B20 installed on your
system, then uninstall it. Especially make sure that you delete the
@code{/} and @code{/bin} mount points (i.e., execute the commands @code{umount
/} and @code{umount /bin} before deleting the installed Cygwin
programs).
@item 
If you have Cygwin version 1.0 or higher installed on your system, you
should either uninstall it, or, do not install the Cygwin component contained
in the @sc{Singular} installation archives.
@item 
If you are running Windows NT/2000, make sure that you are logged on as
@code{Administrator}.
@item
Execute the self-extracting archive (e.g., double-click on it) and
@strong{carefully} follow the instructions given there.
@item 
When asked for the installation folder, you should simply choose a drive
(you may choose a subfolder, but this is not as convenient as a drive).
@strong{Important:} If you have Cygwin already installed on your system, 
make sure that the folder you choose is mounted to the root of your
(Cygwin) file system.
@item
When asked for the Setup Type, choose @code{Typical}, unless you know
what you are doing. 
@* If you choose @code{Compact}, the XEmacs editor is
excluded from the installation. 
@* If you choose @code{Custom}, make sure that you do @emph{not}
de-select the @code{BasicCygwin} component, unless you already have
Cygwin version 1.0   (or higher) installed on your system. 
@* If you have the @emph{Cygwin} port of XEmacs version 21.1.10 (or higher)
already installed on your system, you can safely de-selct the
@code{XEmacs} component. All other version of Emacs (resp. XEmacs) have
some quirks and do not work right together with @sc{Singular} (i.e.,
running @code{Esingular} results in problems).
@* You only should install the @code{AdditionalCygwin} component, if you 
plan on doing some software-development with cygwin. 
@item 
At the end, you @emph{should} reboot your computer. Otherwise, some
