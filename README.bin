      README FILE FOR THE EXECUTABLE SINGULAR PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION
      ============================================================

IMPORTANT: Please see the COPYING.bin file contained in this directory
for license information for the Singular program.

This directory contains 

(1) binary versions of Singular for common hard- and software
    platforms in the files Singular-1.0.<platform>.gz where
    <platform> is, for example, 'linux', 'SunOS', etc.

(2) The file Singular-1.0-share.tar.gz which contains the architecture
    - independent files (such as libraries written in the Singular
    programming language, and the Singular documentation). See the
    file README.share contained in this tar file for more information.

(3) the file COPYING.bin containing the copying and license
    information.


Installing the Singular binaries
================================
In order to use Singular, you 

(1) need to obtain _all_ the three files mentioned above (i.e. obtaining the
    binary, only, is not enough!)

(2) Uncompress the binary and install it at an appropriate place in
    your executable path (e.g., /usr/local/bin)

(3) Unpack Singular-1.0-share.tar.gz 
    (a) in the directory /usr/local/, or
    (b) in another directory, say, $HOME/Singular, and set the environment
        variable SINGULARPATH to the subdirectory
        $HOME/Singular/share/Singular 
	If you use the tcsh or csh shell, this can be accomplished by
	the command 
		'setenv SINGULARPATH $HOME/Singular/share/Singular'.
	If you use the bash, ksh, or sh shell, this can be
	accomplished by the command 
		'export SINGULARPATH=$HOME/Singular/share/Singular'
	Furthermroe, these commands should be put into your shell
	initialization file (e.g., $HOME/.tcshr)

Optional:
(4) You may move the file singular.hlp contained in share/Singular to
    your info diretory (usualy /usr/local/info) and add the line 
* Singular: (singular.hlp). The Singular manual
    to the 'dir' file contained in your info directory.   

(5) You may print the Singular manual (contained in docs/singular.dvi)
    and tutorial (contained in docs/tutorial.dvi).

Overview of Singular
====================
Singular is a special-purpose computer algebra system for commutative
algebra, algebraic geometry and singularity theory. The main features
of Singular are: 

 * Computations in very general rings (polynomial rings, localizations
   of rings at a prime ideal, tensor products of rings) over many
   ground fields (rational numbers, mod p numbers, Galois fields,
   transcendental/algebraic extensions) and monomial orderings (all
   standard monomial orderings, including matrix orderings)

 * Very fast standard (resp. Groebner) bases computations

 * Polynomial factorization, resultant, and gcd computations

 * Large variety of implemented related algorithm: FGLM,
   Hilbert-driven, Factorizing Buchberger; Minimal resolutions,
   Primary decomposition; Usual ideal theoretic operations; standard
   combinatorial algorithms.

 * Efficient and flexible communication links based on the MP
   protocol and library

 * Easy-to-use, command-driven user-interface

 * Intuitive, C-like programming language

 * Extensive libraries of procedures, written in Singular's
   programming language

 * Written in C/C++. Available as binary program for common hard- and
   software platforms (including most Un*x variants, MS-DOG, MacOS)
