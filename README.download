Not that (starting from Singular version 1.2.0 on) different versions
of Singular can peaceable coexist within the same directory
structure. That is, if you had previously downloaded Singular version
1.2.0, you  can simply unpack version 1.2.1 at the same place.


To download Singular for Unix platforms:
========================================
You need at least the following two files: 
      Singular-1.2.1-share.tar.gz 
      Singular-1.2.1-<uname description>.tar.gz
where <uname description> is a description of the processor and operating
system for which Singular is compiled (e.g, ix86-Linux). Please
contact us if you can not find an appropriate architecture-dependent
tar file. 

Simply cd to the directory in which you wish to install SINGULAR,
and then unpack the architecture independent tar file, followed by
the architecture-dependent files for those architectures you use:

  cd /usr/local/	# or wherever you install 3rd-party software
  gzip -dc Singular-1.2.1-share.tar.gz | tar -pxf -
  gzip -dc Singular-1.2.1-<uname description>.tar.gz | tar -pxf -

You may replace `/usr/local/' with what you like, but refer to the
INSTALL file which is contained in the architecture-dependent tar file
(and which you can find at ./Singular/INSTALL after unpacking) for
detailed information on how to install Singular.

To download Singular for Windows 95/NT 
======================================
If you have a Windows unzip utility program (like WinZip) installed
on your system then simply double-click on the file
`Singular-<x-y-z>-ix86-Win.zip' and extract the content of the archive 
at a directory in which you usually install 3rd-party software.

Otherwise, download the file `unzip.exe' from
   ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/utils 
start an MS-DOS terminal, move the Singular archive and unzip program to
a place in which you usually install 3rd-party software and extract
(unpack) the archive with the command:
  unzip Singular-<x-y-z>-ix86-Win.zip

After extraction, follwo the instructions in the `./Singular/INSTALL'
file contained in the archive.

To download Singular for the Macintosh:
=======================================
Download the file Singular-<x-y-z>-<target>-MPW.sea.hqx. Expand the
downloaded file using a standard Expander (like Compact Pro or StuffIt)
to obtain the corresponding self-extracting
Singular-<x-y-z>-<target>-MPW.sea file.  Click on the self-extracting
Singular-1-2-1-<target>-MPW.sea file. This  will create a folder
named "Singular" which contains the file 'INSTALL'. Follow the
instructions contained in this file for further installation
instructions.
