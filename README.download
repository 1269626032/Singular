DOWNLOAD:
=========
(1) Download two files:
        One of      `Singular-<x.y.z>-share.[tar.gz,zip,sea.hqx]'
        AND, one of `Singular-<x.y.z>-<uname>.[tar.gz,zip,sea.hqx]'
    where <uname> is a description of your hardware and
    operating system. 
    Messages from tar like "Could not create symlink to ..."

    contained in the `INSTALL' file of the architecture dependent
