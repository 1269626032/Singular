To download Singular for Unix platforms:
========================================
You need at least the following two files: 
      Singular-1.2.0-share.tar.gz 
      Singular-1.2.0-<uname description>.tar.gz
where <uname description> is a description of the processor and operating
system for which Singular is compiled (e.g, ix86-Linux). Please
contact us if you can not find an appropriate architecture-dependent
tar file. 

Simply cd to the directory in which you wish to install SINGULAR,
and then unpack the architecture independent tar file, followed by
the architecture-dependent files for those architectures you use:

  cd /usr/local/	# or wherever you install 3rd-party software
  gzip -dc Singular-1.2.0-share.tar.gz | tar -pxf -
  gzip -dc Singular-1.2.0-<uname description>.tar.gz | tar -pxf -

You may replace `/usr/local/' with what you like, but refer to the
INSTALL file which is contained in the architecture-dependent tar file
(and which you can find at ./Singular/INSTALL after unpacking) for
detailed information on how to install Singular.

To download Singular for Windows 95/NT 
======================================
If you have a Windows unzip utility program (like WinZip) installed
on your system then simply double-click on the file
`Singular-<x-y-z>-ix86-Win.zip' and extract the content of the archive 
at a directory in which you usually install 3rd-party software.

Otherwise, download the file `unzip.exe' from
   ftp://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/pub/Math/Singular/utils 
start an MS-DOS terminal, move the Singular archive and unzip program to
a place in which you usually install 3rd-party software and extract
(unpack) the archive with the command:
  unzip Singular-<x-y-z>-ix86-Win.zip

After extraction, follwo the instructions in the `./Singular/INSTALL'
file contained in the archive.

To download Singular for the Macintosh:
=======================================
Sorry, the Macintosh distribution is not yet ready. However, it will
available at July 1, at the latest.
