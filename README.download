To download Singular for Unix platforms:
========================================
You need at least the following two files: 
      Singular-1.2.0-share.tar.gz 
      Singular-1.2.0-<uname description>.tar.gz
where <uname description> is a description of the processor and operating
system for which Singular is compiled (e.g, ix86-Linux) -- you should
pick the description which is closest to your local machine. 

Simply cd to the directory in which you wish to install SINGULAR,
and then unpack the architecture independent tar file, followed by
the architecture-dependent files for those architectures you use:

  cd /usr/local/	# or wherever you install 3rd-party software
  gzip -dc Singular-<x.y.z>-share.tar.gz .tar.gz | tar -pxf -
  gzip -dc Singular-<x.y.z>-<uname description> | tar -pxf -

You may replace `/usr/local/' with what you like, but refer to the
INSTALL file contained in the executable distribution for more
detailed info on how to install Singular.
