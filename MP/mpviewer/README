This directory contains initial work on:

mpview

a program that can display file.mp, an mp-encoded data file,
in prefix, infix, or latex form.  See testall for the usage.
The work is imcomplete by far:

(1) displaying annotations has to be addressed
(2) Many latex constructs to be added
(3) must be tested and ported on different platforms

The purpose is for mpview to be a viewer for mp data files just like
a .gif viewer.  It can then be used together with MIME mail and
on the Web.  We use application/mp as the MIME document type for mp.
A simple previewer program for .mp files is found in the
displaymp script.

To enable MIME mail viewing of MP data modify the following line and
add to your ~/.mailcap file something like the following

application/mp;  LOCAL_BIN_PATH/displaymp %s

where LOCAL_BIN_PATH is the full pathname to where displaymp will 
be installed.  For example,

application/mp;  /users/research/wang/pwang/cmd/displaymp %s

displaymp is a script which will invoke the mpview program, so you
will need to modify displaymp to contain the correct path to where
mpview is to be installed.

This also enables any Web viewer which uses the .mailcap file to
treat this type of MIME data.

To enable a Web browser such as netscape and xmosaic to display
a file with .mp extension you need to also add the following line
to your ~/.mime.types file

application/mp     mp


Another part of this project is the creation of MP data from
MAXIMA.  This facility is in the file "maxima/mpsend.lsp".  See that
file for details of compilation and use.


===============

Files:

mpview.c -- the main program
infix.c -- for converting to infix form
latex.c -- for for converting to latex form
prefix.c -- for converting to prefix form
leaf.c -- handling leaf nodes, used by both infix.c and latex.c
node.c -- this contains knowledge of the .mp binary file structure
          and supplies routines to read a nodes from an mp-tree
          contained in a .mp file.
