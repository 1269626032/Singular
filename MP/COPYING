Dear Jordi, Paul, Simon,

I have no objection either, and agrees with whatever Paul decides.

BTW, I just attended a lecture by Richard Stallman yesterday.  I know next
to nothing about DRM and software licenses but after listening Richard,
my understanding is that a "free" program (in terms of GNU philosophy)
is indeed a program that includes some kind of viral licence (so that
programs derived from a "free" program must remain 100% "free", and so on).

Therefore I am confused with the following sentences :

 > The specific problem is that you do not allow modifications of your code fo
r
 > commercial purposes, which according to the DFSG, makes your code
 > non-free.

Not that I insist on any kind of license, but it looks like I missed
something :-)

Regards,
-- Norbert

Jordi,

I am agreeable to any reasonable license including GLP.

I am forwarding the msg to Simon and Norbert to see what
they say.
