 *
 *  Change Log:
 *       July 7, 1995  SG - updated MP_errlist[] to reflect newtypes
 *                          in MP-1.0 and coelesced a few error types.
 *                          Also made the necessary changes to 
 *                          MP_Error.c, MP_Put.c, MP_Get.c
 *       July 21, 1995 SG - more additions/corrections.  Checked against
 *                          MP_Error.h for accuracy (enums with corresponding
 *                          error messages)
 *       September 11, 1995 SG - Added MP_LogEvent().
 *       November 20, 1995 SG - added MP_Failure and MP_Success to be 
 *                              consistent with the enums in MP_Error.h.
