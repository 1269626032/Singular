	* MPT_Tree.c (MPT_CpyNode): Changed name MPT_CpyAp to MPT_InitCpyAp

Sat Mar 29 10:07:52 1997  Simon Gray  (sgray@Pooh)

	* Makefile.in: Moved MPT.h to the MPT subdirectory and changed
	  Makefile.in to install the header file in the subdir where all
	  the MP include files are installed.  Also changed uninstall so
	  that it will rm MPT.h from the include subdir.

          - removed all references to $(MP_ARCH), which is now obsolete
	    because it is handled by configure.
