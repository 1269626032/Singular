Degree functions for the leading term (wrt. the monomial ordering)
==================================================================

p_Deg: a degree that is compatible with the monomial ordering
       (i.e. for dp: totaldegree, for lp(lex): exponent of first variable, etc.)
p_FDeg: a degree for use in GB computations:
       (i.e. p_Deg for degree orderings, p_Totaldegree for block orderings (lex)
        or mixed orderings).
       Requirement: there are only finitely many monomials of the same degree
p_Totaldegree: the sum of all exponents (the usual total degree)
p_WTotaldegree: the weighted sum of all exponents (the usual weigthed degree)
p_WDegree: the weighted sum of all exponents (obsolete)
p_WFirstTotalDegree: the weighted sum of the exponents of the first block

Degree function for a polynomial
==================================
p_LDeg: return the length and the maximal degree wrt. p_FDeg

Ring properties wrt. monomial orderings
=======================================
OrdSgn: 1 for well ordering (i.e. 1 is the smallest monomial)
        -1 otherwise
MixedOrder: 0 for well orderings 
         and local orderings (i.e. 1 is the largest monomial)
LexOrder: 1 for block orderings (incl. lex), 0 otherwise
